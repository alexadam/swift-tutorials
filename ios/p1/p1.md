# Create a iOS app with Swift 4 (Swift 5), without storyboards

## Part 1 - Setup

## Step 1

Open **Xcode** -> select **iOS** -> **Single View App**

## Step 2

Set **Product Name**, **Organization Name** etc.

## Step 3

Click on the root of the Project navigator, on **Test**, the projectâ€™s name

then

on **Development Info** section, delete the **Main** text in the **Main Interface** field

and check **Requires Full Screen**

## Step 4

Create a new Swift file in the Test folder (at the same level with **AppDelegate.swift**)
	name it **main.swift** (with lower-case letters)

then paste this code:

```
import UIKit

UIApplicationMain(
    CommandLine.argc,
    CommandLine.unsafeArgv,
    nil,
    NSStringFromClass(AppDelegate.self)
)
```

## Step 5

In the **AppDelegate.swift** file, remove **@NSApplicationMain** above the **AppDelegate** class declaration

then paste the following code in **func application(...)** :

```
window = UIWindow(frame: UIScreen.main.bounds)
window?.rootViewController = ViewController()
window?.makeKeyAndVisible()
```

## Step 6

In the **ViewController.swift** file, add the following code in **func viewDidLoad()** after **super.viewDidLoad()** :

```
view.backgroundColor = .blue
```

![i3][logo6]

## Step 7

Move to Trash the **Main.storyboard** file

Run the application. You should see a blue window, like in the example below:

## Note

Don't delete the file **LaunchScreen.storyboard** (you have to use it as a launch screen - or you can use static images instead...)
